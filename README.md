# Improving the State Selectivity of Field Ionization with Quantum Control

I presented this poster at the [2018 meeting of the Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics of the American Physical Society](https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DAMOP18/Session/M01.107). This is a meeting of experts in the field, so the poster is aimed at a highly technical audience. The work described in this poster is a project to use a genetic algorithm to separate previously overlapped field ionization signals from two different atomic energy states. A description of the project aimed at non-physicists is provided in the document `Project_Description.md`.

The data for this project was collected using custom data aquisition software written in C#, and analyzed in Mathematica. The graphs in the poster were created using Inkscape.
